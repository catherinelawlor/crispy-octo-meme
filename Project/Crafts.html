    <p>Now let’s start building! First, we’ll create the basic shape of your horse’s head. Think of this like making a soft toy — you’re going to cut out two identical shapes, one for each side of the horse’s face.           </p>
        <h3>Step One</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>Download or draw a simple horse head pattern.
                    You can sketch your own or download a printable one <a href="downloads/horse head template/horse head template PDF.pdf" >(you can download by clicking here).</a></li>
                <li>Fold your fabric in half.
                    This way, when you cut, you’ll get two matching shapes instantly.</li>
                <li>Trace the pattern.
                    Use a washable marker or chalk to lightly outline the horse head onto your fabric.</li>
                <li>Cut carefully.
                    Cut through both layers along the outline, making two identical pieces.</li>
                <li>Cut two small ear shapes.
                    Use the same or a different fabric for a fun contrast.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Step Two</h3>

        <p>Sew or Glue the Head Together</p>

        <p>Sewing Method:</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Place both fabric pieces together, with the patterned or “good” sides facing inward (the part that will show once turned inside out).</li>
                <li>Pin around the edges, leaving the bottom (neck) open</li><li>
                <li>Use a simple stitch — straight or backstitch — and sew all the way around the edges. Go slowly around curves like the nose or ears.</li>
                <li>4.	Leave a 3–4 cm gap at the bottom for stuffing and the stick.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Hot Glue Method (if you’re not sewing):</p>
                <ul>
                <li> Lay both pieces down just like above (good sides in).
                <li> Run a thin line of glue along the edges — not too close to the edge!
                <li> Press together firmly section by section.
                <li>Let it cool and dry fully before moving on.
                </ul>

        <h3>Step 3 – Add the Mane and Ears</h3> 
        <p>For the Mane:</p>
            <ul> 
                <li>Cut strands of yarn about 15–20 cm each.</li>
                <li>You’ll need around 30–50 pieces, depending on how thick you want the mane.</li>  
                <li>With the horse head still inside out, place yarn strands along the top seam (where the mane should go).</li>
                <li>Pin them in place, then sew or glue the yarn so it’s trapped in the seam.</li>
                <li>When you flip the horse right-side out, the yarn will hang like a real mane!</li>
            </ul>
        <p>For the Ears:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ears usually go about halfway between the top and eye level.</li>
                <li>Take the two ear shapes and fold the bottom slightly to give them shape.</li>
                <li>Stitch or glue each ear to the sides of the horse head.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
                
        <h3>Step 4 – Stuff Head and Insert Stick</h3>
                
        <p> Carefully push the head through the opening to flip it right side out. You can use a chopstick or pencil to poke out the nose area fully.    </p>
        <p> Stuff It:</p>
            <ul> 
                <li>Use your fingers to fill the head with stuffing.</li>
                <li>Pack it evenly — not too loose or too tight.</li>
                <li>Shape the nose, cheeks, and neck so it looks natural.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="photos/4Making-hobby-horse-at-home-768x512.png"

            <br>

        <p>Insert the Stick:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>  Take a smooth wooden stick and slide it up into the neck opening.      </li>
                <li>  Push it in deep enough so the head feels secure.    </li>
                <li>  Fold the fabric around the stick and sew or glue it closed tightly. You can even tie a ribbon around it to make it extra strong      </li>
            </ul>
           
         <h3>Step 5 – Add Personality and Style</h3>  

        <p> This is where your horse becomes your horse. You can customize your horse the way you want by adding decorative elements and then you can assign a favorite name to your hobby horse. Here are few ideas for customization.    </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Eyes: Use buttons, felt, or even googly eyes.     </li>
                <li> Nostrils: Draw or stitch little curves near the nose.   </li>
                <li> Bridle or Halter: Use thin ribbon or lace to “dress” the horse.   </li>
                <li> Bridle or Halter: Use thin ribbon or lace to “dress” the horse.  </li>
                <li> Extras: Ribbons in the mane, flowers, glitter glue accents.   </li>
            </ul>
