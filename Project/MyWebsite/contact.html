    <p>Hobby horsing is accessible, inclusive, and expressive. You don’t need a real horse — just imagination and a stick horse. 
        <br>It offers:
        <ul>
        <li>    Physical exercise</li>
        <li>    Creativity through costume and horse design</li>
        <li>    Confidence building</li>
        <li>    A strong sense of community</li>
        <li>A low‑cost entry into equestrian‑style sport </li>
</ul>
</p>

    <p>Online communities, especially on Instagram and TikTok, have helped the movement explode globally.
Getting Started
Beginners only need:
- A hobby horse (simple or professional)
- Comfortable athletic clothing
- Good sports shoes
- Optional accessories like bridles, halters, or grooming kits
Many riders join local clubs or online groups, where they learn routines, practice jumps, and participate in events. </p>
